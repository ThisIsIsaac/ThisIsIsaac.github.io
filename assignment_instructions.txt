# Assignment Instructions

## Logistics
1. You CANNOT consult ANY material other than CUDA C Programming guide for API DOCUMENTATIONS only. This means you cannot consult with fellow students, consult any code from the internet or CUDA C Programming guide.
1. use CUDA toolkit 9.2 or newer
1. use GPUs of Pascal architecture (GTX10xx series) or newer

---

## General Instructions
1. Variable name should follow the convention of prepending `h_` for host and `d_` for device memory
1. ALL CUDA Runtime API calls should be wrapped by a function that checks the status and raises error properly. You can copy and paste the code from [Introduction to Global Memory](https://joongkunlee.ghost.io/introduction_to_global_memory/) notes under section “Error Checking Macro”.
1. Each problem should be saved in a separate `.cuh` file (NOT `.cu`!).
1. You will be able to grade your own code with the released grading code in the [github repo](https://github.com/ThisIsIsaac/CUDA_course_assignments). You MUST NOT edit and commit ANY code associated with grading.
1. read [Measuring Runtime of Kernels](https://joongkunlee.ghost.io/measuring_runtime_of_kernels/) and measure the runtime of any kernel you are asked to write as part of the assignment you will hand in.
1. You must free ALL allocated resources. (i.e. make sure to `cudaFree()` or `free()` ALL dynamically allocated memory).
